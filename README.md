# Stacks and Queues

## Overview

This repository provides implementations and explanations of Stacks and Queues in the C programming language. Stacks and Queues are fundamental data structures that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) and First In, First Out (FIFO) principles, respectively.

## Stack Implementation

The stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. In this repository, you will find a C implementation of a stack using a linked list.

- [stack.h](stack.h): Header file defining the stack structure and function prototypes.
- [stack.c](stack.c): Implementation of stack functions.

## Queue Implementation

The queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This repository provides a C implementation of a queue using a linked list.

- [queue.h](queue.h): Header file defining the queue structure and function prototypes.
- [queue.c](queue.c): Implementation of queue functions.

## Usage

To use the stack and queue implementations in your C program, include the respective header files in your source code and link with the provided implementation files.

Example usage of the stack:

```c
#include "stack.h"

int main() {
    // Your stack-related code here
    return 0;
}
